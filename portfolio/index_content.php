				<h2><a href="#">Rainier Hills Christian Fellowship</a></h2><h4>Logo Design</h4>
				<p>Rainier Hills wanted to update their logo from years past to fit the look an feel of their newly updated website. After discussing the particulars with the client I had some ideas which incorporated their need. In the end I presented them with two variations of the logo, one black and one white. A final decision of white was made in order to really mesh well with the existing white text on the site.</p>

				<h2><a href="#">December Rose Photography</a></h2><h4>Logo Design</h4>
				<p>December Rose Photography is a photography business based out of Buckley, WA. DRP needed a logo designed to be used as a watermark for photos and also a company logo. After discussions with the client, the decision was made to use a semi-photo-realistic design which visually communicates the idea behind the studio's name; a rose in December is both treasured and something to be remembered, just like a great photograph.</p>
